# one-light.vim

Building a vim version of the default Atom dark color scheme, but light this time. Using elements of Jellybeans and Solarized to accomplish the task.

## This is a work in progress
This color palette will not work unless your editor supports 24-bit (true)
color. In Neovim, you can enable this by setting the environment variable
`NVIM_TUI_ENABLE_TRUE_COLOR` before starting your `nvim`.

## Forked for custom colors
Directory listing color changed
